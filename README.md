It is designed to run on Android 5 so it can work on over 95% of android devices. This app requires an Android Gradle Plugin version 7.2.2, and gradle 7.5 to build.

The app is also designed to redirect the user to the repo when one of the list items is clicked, as well as show an error message when it fails to retrieve the repositories.
